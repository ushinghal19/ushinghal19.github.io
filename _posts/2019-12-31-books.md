# Reading

I didn't like reading in high school. I thought it was a big waste of time. But as I began to read more, 
I found myself learning a lot about things that really interested me. 
Although I still have a hard time forcing myself to sit down and read a book 
rather than watch some youtube, I definitely do have a newfound appreciation for reading. 
Thus, I have started incorporating a little bit of reading into my daily life.

Currently I am reading:

<div class="book-post">

<img class="book" src="/images/blog/books/thinkingfastandslow.jpg" alt="thinkingfastandslow"/>
</div>

In the recent past, I have read:  

* **The Last Lecture** - *Randy Pausch*
* **When Breath Becomes Air** - *Paul Kalanithi*
