## Online Courses

Learning for the sake of learning, not worried about grades :)

- [The Web Developer's Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
    - This course gives a complete rundown of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for any beginner (like me)! I highly recommend it!
- [The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/)
    - A wonderful course detailing almost everything there is to the wonderful language of Python!
- [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (IPR)
    - A really fascinating topic, one that I am hoping to dive into as soon as possible :)


## University Courses

A list of the courses I have taken so far at the University of Toronto!
